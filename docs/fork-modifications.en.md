### Published session fix

- v0.9.5 `load_session` treats an unmatched `tool_use` as evidence of a crashed process. That assumption is invalid when Pinvou persists a live tool call and reads the same session again during the turn.
- The engine fix was merged through `Pinvou/CodeWhale#11`; its public commit is `2eceab4e19cb0b15576c09d5b89e0d8bc42e11fd`.
- T1 now separates side-effect-free `load_session_snapshot` from explicit `recover_session_for_resume`. Pinvou uses snapshots for all runtime read-modify-write paths and performs durable recovery only during app process startup, before any Engine can own a session.
- Revision reconciliation remains fail-closed only for genuine cross-client turns. A local `chat:done` immediately releases the next send, readback failures cannot block ordinary local chat, and cross-client pending notices are deduplicated per session.
- Two CodeWhale tests, two parent `forkguard_*` tests, and Tauri/Web frontend behavior coverage protect side-effect-free runtime reads, observable and idempotent explicit recovery, safe secondary Store opening, durable startup recovery, and consecutive sends after local completion.
- The fix is included in the published head, drift figures, and immutable tag `pinvou-v0.9.5-r5`; CodeWhale required checks and parent automation pass.

### Vision adaptation (2026-08-12 · slow-device timeout + configurability)

> Status: integrated into `pinvou3-clean-v0.9.6` (`e7bda367b` + `944a844a2`).
> See the Chinese canonical document §6 for the full v0.9.6 upgrade record.

- `image_analyze` uses **streaming** (`stream: true`) with a total per-request
  budget of **90s** (configurable via `request_timeout_secs`), measured from
  before `send()` so waiting for response headers is bounded too; on timeout
  the accumulated partial content is returned with a `truncated` marker instead
  of failing the whole request into a retry loop.
- **Limited retry**: only HTTP 429/499/5xx (max 2 retries, 1s→2s backoff,
  `Retry-After` honored up to 10s); timeouts and network errors never retry.
- Streaming robustness: byte-buffered SSE line splitting (no cross-chunk UTF-8
  corruption), mid-stream read errors return partial content + `truncated`,
  and a response with no SSE events and empty content is reported as an error
  (distinguishes "endpoint ignored `stream`" from "empty image").
- `VisionModelConfig` gained six optional fields (`system_prompt`,
  `default_prompt`, `max_output_tokens`, `temperature`,
  `request_timeout_secs`, `stream`), all `None`-fallback to prior behavior.
  Prompts and `temperature: 0.2` are now injected by the app layer
  (`bridge.rs`); the fork delta shrinks to mechanism only.

## Topics

1. **Host embedding and routing boundary** — `331cb1594688c723d98499d9ca11f05af291b599` plus `2eceab4e19cb0b15576c09d5b89e0d8bc42e11fd` (`Pinvou/CodeWhale#11`). Exposes only the library modules, narrow root-level Fleet roster API, read-only live-worker projection, opaque resolved-route interfaces, and distinct runtime-snapshot versus process-resume session APIs required by the host; the full `fleet` module remains private.
2. **Tool compatibility and command-execution safety** — `595adce47e2d1bcf895d7bfd6426c074eb969324`. Adds host `extra_tools`, dynamic `SetDisallowedTools`, file-size enforcement, and fail-closed multiline command safety while reusing upstream `allowed_tools`.
3. **Embedded context and Skill sources** — `5a9f52941b83452c1e8b76c2d679bac315edcf70`. Seals ambient project authority, scans only the explicit Skill root, filters disabled Skills, preserves up to 100 KiB only for the Permissions fragment, and excludes internal reminders from Working Set extraction.
4. **Automation and runtime lifecycle** — `fc84f7d3e5dca0e3db404d43e218597764129f9b`. Preserves stable conversation/thread identity, v4 task compatibility, anchored schedules, no-backfill/no-overlap behavior, and terminal-only cleanup.
5. **Three Departments and Six Ministries orchestration, completion gate, and structured-output safety** — `3782a78d4e11d1fb65042cf9c82231b9d644c20a` plus `d1010aa3bbaf76780e29df4434fd1e03a95b2ca6`. Adds the role/tool/step/output contract, bounded write claims, explicit host-selected output roots, traversal and symlink-escape rejection, safe structured persistence, file-completion gate, cancellation, and authoritative terminal result needed by that workflow.

Pinvou's product tool allowlist, connector state, UI, workspace selection, bundle instructions, session Skill materialization, and presentation remain in `pinvou3-app`.

## v0.9.5 migration notes

- The parent passes through the new `EngineConfig.subagent_state_root` field.
- The removed legacy `hidden_tools` field is not restored; session-level hiding already uses dynamic `disallowed_tools` shaping.
- The upstream 40 KiB WorldState cap is retained globally. Only `FragmentId::Permissions` uses the existing 100 KiB instruction limit.
- The parent lockfile reflects the v0.9.5 workspace-crate split without adding a new direct Pinvou dependency.

## Verification

- CodeWhale format and locked library check pass.
- All 23 CodeWhale `forkguard_*` tests pass.
- Parent locked Rust check and desktop binary link pass.
- Parent library tests pass: 1077 passed, 0 failed, and 12 environment-dependent tests ignored.
- Parent fork guard, architecture guard, npm tests, UI lint, desktop UI build, and web UI build pass.
- Full product results are recorded in `docs/codewhale-upgrade-0.9.0-to-0.9.5.md`.

Any fork-distinct change must update this register, guard fingerprints, and a result-oriented behavior test, then pass `./scripts/fork-guard.sh --fast`.
